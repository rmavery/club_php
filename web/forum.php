									<p>I'm looking for a good template for a forum/bulletin board/message board or whatever you want to call it.   I'd love to write something from scratch  
									I really like the look and feel of <a href="https://discuss.flarum.org/">Flarum</a>.  Unfortunately, it requires ssh access to the server to install 
									and I really want to try to create something that doesn't require that so I can install it in a shared hosting, e.g., Hostgator, GoDaddy, etc.  </p>
