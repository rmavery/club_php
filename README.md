# club_php
Generic PHP web for club, HOA, or any other group that contains the basic components for organizational communication.

# OverView
My HOA is basically broke.   We wanted to put together a website that would provide basic communication capabilities.  I wasn't able to find one that had what we needed, without starting from scratch.   This project (currently in conceptual stage), is to see if I can create a template that we, and ultimately other organizations can use to build a community site.
